# E. coli Stress Transcriptomics

## Background
This project documents a reproducible RNA-seq analysis workflow focusing on differential expression and volcano plot visualization in Escherichia coli under stress conditions.

## Data
Processed differential expression results were used. No raw sequencing data are included.

## Analysis
- Volcano plot reproduction
- Differential gene classification
- Basic biological interpretation

## Status
This is an educational and training project. Future extensions may include functional enrichment analysis.
